Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

- Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. it includes using a systematic approach to the development of software, with the aim to ensure that the product is high quality and reliable.
- The difference between software engineering and traditional programming is the amount of planning and organisation involved in the process. Traditional programming typically involves writing code to solve a specific problem or add/implement functionality.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1. Planning: This is the first phase of the cycle. In this phase, the team or designers list the requirements and objectives of the project, this includes gathering requirements. creating a plan (which could include who does what, when it should be done and the resources on hand or needed) and determining the feasibility of the project. This is the foundation of the life cycle and might make or break the process.

2. Analysis: This phase involves detailed analysis of the requirements gathered in the planning phase and creating a detailed requirements document. This will serve as a blueprint/roadmap for the development team.

3. Design: Once analysis is done, thats when the design phase begins with a clear plan of action. In this phase, the system architecture is translated into a detailed design. The team designs the user interface, database structure, algorithms and database/data structures. This is done in accordance to the requirements specificed.

4. Implementation: This is when the coding of the software takes place. The designers design it according to the what the designs/designers specified.This phase involves programming, unit testing, and integration testing to ensure that individual components work together as intended.

5. Testing: In this phase, the software is tested to identify and fix any defects. Testing can include various types such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing. This is to ensure that the software meets the requirements and works as intended.

6. Deployment: After passing the testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. This involves installing the software, configuring it and makeing it available to users.

7. Maintenance: After the software is deployed, it enters into the maintenance phase which comprises of updates. enhanchments and patches which is meant to address any issues discovered after deployment or to add any new features.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile Model
-Development is divided into small, iterative cycles called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks.

- Continuous interaction with the customer or end-users to gather feedback and make adjustments.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Changes can be accommodated at any point in the development process.

Waterfall Model

- The development process flows in a single direction, like a waterfall.
- The process consists of well-defined stages: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Emphasis on comprehensive documentation at each phase.

Key differences

- Documentation: Agile focuses on necessary documentation while Waterfall focuses on comprehensive documentation.
  Testing: Agile integrates testing throughout the development cycle while Waterfall conducts the testing after the implementation phase

Waterfall may be preferred for projects with well-defined requirements, regulatory constraints, and a need for extensive documentation. Agile is better suited for projects requiring flexibility, continuous customer feedback, and incremental delivery of functional software.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering is a systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. The process is:

1. Requirements Elicitation: In this stage requirements are gather from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, questionnaires etc which then gives them an initial set of raw rquirements.

2. Requirements Analysis: in this stage, the requirements are refined to ensure clarity, completeness, consistency and feasibility. This is done using prioritisation, modeling and prototyping this gives them a more detailed and structured set of requirements.

3. Requirements Specification: In this stage, the requirements are documented in a clear and precise manner using a Software Requirements Specification document, user stories or use case diagram.

4. Requirements Validation: in this stage, the document is scrutinized to ensure that the requirements are documented accurately to reflect the stakeholders needs/expectations. This is done using reviews, inspections and prototype demonstrations. This helps them get approval from stakeholders

5. Requirements Management: In this stage, the team tracks and manages changes to the requirements throughout the lifecycle using version control, traceability matrices and impact analysis.

This is importanant because it establishes a shared understanding between the stakeholders and the development team about the software.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.

Differnt types of maintenance activities

- Corrective Maintenance: Involves identifying and fixing defects or bugs in the software.
  Adapative Maintenance: Entails making changes to the software to keep it usable in a new or changed environment. This could involve adapting to new hardware, operating systems, or integration with other software systems.
- Perfective Maintenance: Involves enhancing or improving the software to increase its performance, maintainability, or other attributes. This type of maintenance is proactive and aims at making the software better rather than just keeping it functional.
- Preventive Maintenance: Focuses on identifying and fixing potential issues before they become actual problems. This type of maintenance aims to prevent faults and improve the software's robustness.

Maintenance is essential because it ensures continuity, this is because the maintenance ensures that the software is reliable and meets user needs consistently. Maintenance als ensures that the software adapts to changing environements like technological advances.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

- Privacy and Data Protection: Since there is sensitive user data that is used or handled, the issue is whether the data is safe from being missued or breached which if not can lead to identity theft and legal consequences.
- Security: There has to be a level of security involved to ensure that personal information, financial data and critical infrastructure is protected from malicious attacks. if there isnt then the information can be compromised.
- Algorithm bias: Most of the softwares use algorithms to better the user experience, this might be problematic if the algorith is biased against certain groups of people. This can be seen in hiring, lending and law enforcement even medical care provision.

Adherence to ethical standards :

- Continous learning: This includes thing like ethics courses, and learning about releveant laws.
- Follow established professional codes of conduct, such as those provided by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
